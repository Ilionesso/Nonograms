# Nonograms

A little web game Nonograms, a high school semester work.
* About nonograms (japanese crosswords): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

By doing this work I purposed improving (making) front-end skills and creating data/application model for another project: the same game in 3D.

There are a one-page simple menu, page about the game, options page and some game tasks.
Also application supports game saving/loading, limited offline work and different minor features.
